Arctos IconTheme
================

The Arctos icon theme provides a set of minimalist, monochrome, icons for the KDE desktop.

It requires the Oxygen icon theme, installed by default with KDE SC, so that it can inherit most of the icons from it. 

Some icons are originaly, or inspired by, icons from:
* Android Holo Icons, used under the Apache2 License
* Proto Icons (http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/?content=148902)
* The Noun Project (http://thenounproject.com/)
